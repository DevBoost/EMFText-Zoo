/**
 * Something that implements the <code>Label</code> interface can act as a
 * constituent, node, or word label with linguistic attributes.
 * A <code>Label</code> is required to have a "primary" <code>String</code>
 * <code>value()</code> (although this may be null).  This is referred to as
 * its <code>value</code>.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of Label split into two groups with
 * respect to equality. Classes that extend ValueLabel define equality
 * solely in terms of String equality of its value (secondary facets may be
 * present but are ignored for purposes of equality), and have equals and
 * compareTo defined across all subclasses of ValueLabel. This behavior
 * should not be changed. Other classes that implement Label define equality only
 * with their own type and require all fields of the type to be equal.
 * <p>
 * A subclass that extends another Label class <i>should</i> override
 * the definition of <code>labelFactory()</code>, since the contract for
 * this method is that it should return a factory for labels of the
 * exact same object type.
