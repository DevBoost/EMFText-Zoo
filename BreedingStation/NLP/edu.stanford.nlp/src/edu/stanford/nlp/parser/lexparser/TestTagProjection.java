// Looks like the intended behavior of TestTagProjection is:
// 1) Include the basic category (everything before a '-' or '^' annotation)
// 2) Include any annotation introduced with '-'
// 3) Exclude any annotation introduced with '^'
// 4) Annotations introduced with other characters will be included or excluded
//    as determined by the previous annotation or basic category.
//
// This seems awfully haphazard :(
