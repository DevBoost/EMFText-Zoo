Our point of view.

One can endlessly debate about the best way to develop software. It starts with controversial discussions about operating systems and programming languages, continues with disputes about the right development processes and ends with questions of principle about where to place a space or tabulator character. Developers love these discussions, and in many cases they are necessary and useful. Although we share this joy in technical debates at DevBoost, we are convinced that software development is much more.

Software is made for humans - for a single reason: Software should help and support us by taking over tedious and tiresome tasks. Unfortunately, few people would approve the statement that software simplifies their life. We at DevBoost believe that this needs to be changed. We are convinced that software needs to comply to highest quality standards.

Without sufficient measurements, a product can not adhere to high customer demands. The more effective these measurements are designed, the less costs are produced. Software, being a virtual property, offers enormous advantages here. Software can be automatically checked, tested and validated - as many times as necessary. Ensuring quality is a question of process, not a question of effort. With the right tools and a clear view of what is necessary, software becomes better with every change, not worse.

If you share this perspective, or if you would like to become convinced of it, contact the team at DevBoost and we talk about the possibilities.
