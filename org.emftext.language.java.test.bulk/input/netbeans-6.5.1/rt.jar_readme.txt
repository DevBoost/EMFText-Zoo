The file

java/io/FileSystem.class

was removed from the rt.jar in order to simulate the correct compile
time classpath for source files with the following imports:
java.io.*;
org.openide.*;

Both packages contain a class with the name 'FileSystem'. At compile time,
the classes in the 'org.openide' package need to have precedence over 
the classes of the package 'java.io'. Since in JaMoPP the classpath is 
not ordered, this can not be emulated. Instead, 'java.io.FileSystem'
was removed completely to let the tests pass.
